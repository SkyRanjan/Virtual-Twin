# Virtual Twin

The Virtual Twin is an AI-powered framework that integrates 3D avatar generation, real-time voice cloning, and conversational AI to create immersive and personalized digital representatives. It is designed to act as a user's virtual counterpart in online meetings, healthcare consultations, and interactive environments.

# Overview

Virtual Twin bridges the gap in current systems by providing real-time response, emotional sensitivity, and personalized digital representation. Using only a 2D image, a short voice sample, and a knowledge base, it generates a dynamic, lifelike virtual persona.

# Capabilities

## 3D Avatar Generation
- Converts 2D images into high-fidelity 3D avatars  
- Utilizes Triplane Neural Representations and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)  
- Supports realistic lip-sync and facial expressions  

## Real-Time Voice Cloning
- Generates natural, human-like speech from a short voice sample  
- Built using Tacotron 2 and WaveRNN pipelines  
- Retains user-specific tone, prosody, and speaking style  

## Conversational AI
- Powered by fine-tuned LLaMA models  
- Provides multi-turn, context-sensitive dialogue  
- Mimics userâ€™s communication style and emotional expressions  

# Use Cases
- Online meetings and professional presentations  
- Healthcare consultations and pre-operative briefings  
- Education and training environments  
- Customer support and service automation
